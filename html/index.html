<p>
SecureDrop is a whistleblower submission system used by news organizations worldwide, including the Washington Post, Der Spiegel, The New York Times, The Guardian, CNN, and others. It is designed to help whistleblowers reach out and share information safely and anonymously.
</p>
<p>While whistleblowing, you should protect yourself as much as you can. SecureDrop is intended to help you do that, while also helping you perform an essential role in civil society. Thank you, and stay safe.
</p>
<p>
To protect your anonymity while submitting a tip via SecureDrop, follow these steps:
</p>

    <details>
        <summary><span class="step-title"><b>Protect yourself first!</b> Your work computer activity may be monitored.</b></span>
    <span class="toggle-text"></span>
    </summary>
<p>
Access to shared data and files in your workplace's network is likely to be monitored and recorded. When viewing workplace files, you should account for this risk if you can.
</p>
    </details>

<details>
    <summary><span class="step-title">Use public Wi-Fi, like a coffee shop or library. Use a computer you own. <b>Never use a work computer.</b></span>
    <span class="toggle-text"></span>
	</summary>
	<p>
	Using a Wi-Fi connection not associated with you, such as in a public place you don't normally go to, will reduce the risk of your internet usage raising suspicion if your network activity is monitored elsewhere. Almost all workplace networks are heavily monitored, and your activity on your workplace computer is likely monitored as well. Donâ€™t use the Wi-Fi at work.
	</p>
</details>

	<details>
        <summary><span class="step-title">Download Tor Browser (<a href="https://torproject.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.torproject.org</a>) on a computer you own and control. Use it for everything related to whistleblowing.</b></span>
    <span class="toggle-text"></span>
	</summary>
	<p>
	You should already be viewing this in Tor Browser on a computer you own - if not, stop, download it on your computer from <a href="https://torproject.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.torproject.org</a> and only then continue. If you are technically inclined, you may want to consider preparing a USB drive with Tails (<a href="https://tails.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://tails.net/</a>) to use Tor Browser and access Securedrop. Tails minimizes any traces left on your computer.
	</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary><span class="step-title">Start Tor Browser and visit the SecureDrop Directory (<a href="https://securedrop.org/directory" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://securedrop.org/directory</a>) to find news outlets.</span>
    <span class="toggle-text"></span>
	</summary>
		<p>
The SecureDrop Directory lists news organizations worldwide that have verified themselves and passed basic validation for their SecureDrop installations. You can search by name, or filter by supported language, country, and the topics that they cover.
</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary><span class="step-title">Look for your chosen organization's SecureDrop address on their listing page, it ends with <kbd>.onion</kbd>.</span>
    <span class="toggle-text"></span>
	</summary>
	<p>
	Some organizations may have their 56-character long-form address listed along with their human-friendly short-form address, like <kbd>[orgname].securedrop.tor.onion</kbd>. Either will work.
	</p>
</details>
<details class="nodetails">
    <summary><span class="step-title">Copy and paste your chosen organization's .onion address into the Tor Browser address bar and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</span>
	</summary></details>

    <details>
        <summary><span class="step-title">Once you are connected to your chosen SecureDrop, follow the onsite instructions.</span>
    <span class="toggle-text"></span>
	</summary>
	<p>
Uploading files via Tor Browser can be slow. If you are planning to upload large files, you should be prepared to wait, and for really large submissions (larger than 500MB) you may need to message journalists via SecureDrop first to arrange other safe transfer methods.

If you want to send more messages and files in the future, or if you want to be able to receive replies from journalists, make a note of your 7-word codename. You can use it to log in again later.

Ideally you should memorize your codename. If that's not possible, then try to record it safely, in a way that doesn't link it to your use of SecureDrop. Never share it with anyone, including journalists. <b>Keep it secret, keep it safe</b>.
	</p>
</details>
<details><summary>
        <span class="step-title">To protect your anonymity, only communicate with your chosen organization via SecureDrop. </span>
    <span class="toggle-text"></span>
	</summary>
	<p>
Do not reach out with more information or look for updates on your SecureDrop messages via other communication methods, as this may compromise your anonymity. Journalists may ask you to switch to other communication methods for follow-up conversations - make sure to insist on methods that use secure encryption, such as Signal, bearing in mind that by default they may not offer the same level of anonymity.
	</p>
</details>
<details><summary>
        <span class="step-title"><b>Continue to protect yourself</b> - don't tell anyone about your choice to blow the whistle!</span>
    <span class="toggle-text"></span>
	</summary>
	<p>
Protect yourself and others by keeping your whistleblowing to yourself.
    </p>
<p>
In some cases, for example, if you need to seek legal counsel, you may decide to contact trusted organizations that provide aid to whistleblowers. If you do so, you should continue to use systems like Signal or SecureDrop to make contact, and you should share as little information as possible, preserving your anonymity if you can.
